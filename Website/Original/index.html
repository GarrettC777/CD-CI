            Many changes in schedule both at school and our personal lives have
            added some spice to the usual cycle of extreme procrastination and
            spontaneous innovation that we call Senior Design. The Group
            consists of five students equipped with a wide range of knowledge,
            however all lack a degree of creativity evidenced by their choice of
            team name.

            Our choice in project has much more meaning than our choice in name
            luckily. A staging Environment is a useful tool to test out new
            configurations without disrupting the live website. Amazon has
            created resources which can be used injunction to automate the
            deployment changes to the staging website as well as the live
            website.

            However, our project was focused on automating the creation of these
            resources using terraform. Terraform is a tool that provides
            infrasructure as code which along with AWS CLI allows us to automate
            the CI/CD Pipeline creation.
